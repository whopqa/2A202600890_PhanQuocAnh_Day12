> Jump right into the lab without reading everything first

---

## 🎯 Goal

Deploy your first AI agent to the cloud in under 30 minutes.

---

## ✅ Prerequisites Check

Run these commands to verify you're ready:

```bash
# Check Python
python --version
# Should be 3.11 or higher

# Check Docker
docker --version
docker compose version

# Check Git
git --version
```

If any command fails, install the missing tool first.

---

## 🚀 Fast Track (30 minutes)

### Step 1: Clone & Setup (2 minutes)

```bash
# Navigate to the project
cd day12_ha-tang-cloud_va_deployment

# Check structure
ls
# Should see: 01-localhost-vs-production, 02-docker, etc.
```

### Step 2: Run Basic Example (3 minutes)

```bash
cd 01-localhost-vs-production/develop
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

In another terminal:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/ask -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "Hello"}'
```

**Expected:** You get a response! 🎉

**Stop the server:** Press `Ctrl+C`

### Step 3: Docker Basics (5 minutes)

```bash
cd ../../02-docker/develop

# Build image
docker build -t my-agent .

# Run container
docker run -p 8000:8000 my-agent
```

Test again:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/ask -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What is Docker?"}'
```

**Expected:** Same response, but now in a container! 🐳

**Stop:** `Ctrl+C` or `docker stop <container-id>`

### Step 4: Deploy to Cloud (10 minutes)

```bash
cd ../../03-cloud-deployment/railway

# Install Railway CLI
npm i -g @railway/cli

# Login (opens browser)
railway login

# Initialize project
railway init

# Deploy!
railway up

# Get your URL
railway domain
```

**Expected:** You get a public URL like `https://your-agent.railway.app`

Test it:
```bash
curl https://your-agent.railway.app/ask -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "Am I on the cloud?"}'
```

**Expected:** Response from the cloud! 🌐

### Step 5: Add Security (10 minutes)

```bash
cd ../../04-api-gateway/develop

# Set API key
export AGENT_API_KEY="my-secret-key"

# Run
python app.py
```

Test without key (should fail):
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/ask -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "Hello"}'
# Expected: 401 Unauthorized
```

Test with key (should work):
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/ask -X POST \
  -H "X-API-Key: my-secret-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "Hello"}'
# Expected: 200 OK
```

## 🎓 What You Just Did

1. ✅ Ran an AI agent locally
2. ✅ Containerized it with Docker
3. ✅ Deployed it to the cloud
4. ✅ Added API key authentication

**Congratulations!** You've completed the basics. 🎉

---

## 📚 Next Steps

Now that you've seen it work, go deeper:

### Option A: Follow Full Lab (Recommended)

Read [CODE_LAB.md](CODE_LAB.md) for detailed explanations and exercises.

**Time:** 3-4 hours  
**Outcome:** Deep understanding + production-ready skills

### Option B: Jump to Final Project

Go straight to Part 6 and build from scratch.

```bash
cd 06-lab-complete
cat README.md
```

**Time:** 1-2 hours  
**Outcome:** Working production agent

### Option C: Explore Examples

Browse through each section's `develop/` and `production/` folders.

**Time:** 1 hour  
**Outcome:** See different patterns and approaches

## 🆘 Stuck?

### Common Issues

**"Port already in use"**
```bash
# Kill process on port 8000
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9
```

**"Docker daemon not running"**
```bash
# macOS: Open Docker Desktop app
# Linux: sudo systemctl start docker
```

**"railway: command not found"**
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm i -g @railway/cli

# Or with Homebrew (macOS)
brew install railway
```

**"Module not found"**
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Use Multiple Terminals

```
Terminal 1: Run server
Terminal 2: Test with curl
Terminal 3: View logs
```

### Tip 2: Keep Docker Desktop Open

Docker commands won't work if Docker Desktop is closed.

### Tip 3: Save Your Commands

Create a `commands.sh` file with your frequently used commands:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# My useful commands

# Build and run
alias build="docker build -t my-agent ."
alias run="docker run -p 8000:8000 my-agent"

# Test
alias test="curl http://localhost:8000/health"
```

### Tip 4: Use .env Files

Instead of exporting variables:
```bash
export API_KEY=secret
export PORT=8000
```

Create `.env` file:
```
API_KEY=secret
PORT=8000
```

Then load it:
```bash
source .env
# or
export $(cat .env | xargs)
```
